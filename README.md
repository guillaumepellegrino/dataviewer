# Iron Eye: Watch and view your data.

A data viewer written in RUST allowing to watch data in real-time (interfacing with DBUS) or view them from files.

The purpose of this crate is to make it easy for a third-party application to display data to an end-user.

GTK4 must be installed to build this application:
```
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev
```
